SAVE GAME INFO

This is indeed the best way. Make certain to get 1.07a. (It has complete no-copy save copy support.)

There are 2 types of no-copy flags. Type 1 is the flag contained in "banner.bin" at offset 0x07. If this is set, the Wii will block copying of the save outright. in BOTH directions. (This means if you bypassed the flag to copy the file to your SD card, and you don't have the flag bypass set, the wii will NOT let you copy the file from the SD back to the system.) (If you select copy, the system will say right then and there "This save cannot be copied.")

Type 2 is a directory called "nocopy". Here, the wii will start the save copy process, and skip EVERYTHING contained within "nocopy" directory. If that results in only "banner.bin" being copied, then the wii will tell you that the save cannot be copied, otherwise it will copy everything outside of the nocopy directory, including banner.bin. As of Gecko 1.07a, Saves of this type are copied COMPLETELY. The Wii does NOT block copying such saves back to the system from the SD card, but it will however honour the nocopy directory when you try to copy the save back off, immediately.

Guitar Hero 3, Guitar Hero Aerosmith, and all NES/SMS/Genesis/TG16/SNES virtual console games use Type 2.

Doctor Mario Online RX uses BOTH type 1 and type 2.

Mario Kart Wii, Mario & Sonic Olympics, Nights: Journey of Dreams, Internet Channel, Nintendo Channel, CHeck Mii Out channel, use Type 1. 

make a generic localGameFilename  function

Need events for progress and Notes Automappings etc
