<h1>Tier Editing</h1>

<h2><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></h2>

<h2>How do I edit the Tiers?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Open the TheGHOSTWiiIsoTool.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Set:-</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0cm' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>TiersCount
     – Amount of tiers you would like</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>TierSongCount
     – Set to the amount of songs in the above tiers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
     yes">  </span>Set “5” for 5 songs per tier or comma separate the values
     e.g. “5,5,5,5,5,5,5,4”. </li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l2 level1 lfo2;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>BonusTierSongsCount
     – The amount of songs that the bonus tier will contain.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<h2>Why are the boss battles removed when editing tiers?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The boss battles are removed to simplify the editing
process. There are checks and flags that indicate that battles exist and how
they work. They just weren’t worth the work involved to preserve /maintain
them.</p>

<h2>How do I add songs and keep the boss battles?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Only set BonusTierSongsCount and leave TiersCount and
TierSongsCount blank. Ensure that RemoveBossBattles is set to No. The ISO being
modified must currently contain the Boss Battles.</p>

<h2>What is the minimum amount of songs and tiers that can be set?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>1 tier with 2 songs - 1 to open the encore and 1 for the
encore itself. 1 bonus song.</p>

<h2>What is the maximum amount of songs and tiers that can be set?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>There is no hard limit. Different combinations of Career
songs and Bonus songs yield different results.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Even the way the songs are distributed over the tiers can have an
effect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There are 2 issues to watch out
for:</p>

<ol style='margin-top:0cm' start=1 type=1>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>The
     save file corrupting. If too many songs are added, the game might play and
     save, but will hang on reload. When testing be sure to clear out any
     existing save file as this can interfere with your results.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='mso-list:l1 level1 lfo3;tab-stops:list 36.0pt'>The
     setlist hangs the instant press the A button to play a song.<span
     style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is normally caused by having too
     many songs in the setlist. Sometimes making less tiers with more songs can
     work around this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If the game
     crashes the instant you move on to it and doesn’t even play the preview
     then try compacting the ISO with the WiiIsoTool – use the “Compact ISO”
     preset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is an known issue
     caused by the version of WiiScrubber currently being used.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Why does the game freeze when I select a song to play?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>See the above question, point 2 specifically.</p>

<h2>Why is Through the Fire and Flames (GH3) / Kings and Queens (GHA) moved to
the end of the setlist?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>These 2 songs are unlocked the first time a career setlist
is completed. Moving them to the end of the career setlist ensures they will
always be playable without being hidden.</p>

<h2>Why does Kings and Queens (GHA) appear twice?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>In GHA kings and queens is included twice. One is the end
credits version and the other is the version that is unlocked after playing the
end credits version.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The end credits
version will always be the last song in the bonus tier. It will still function
as the end credits song, but you can play it whenever you like.</p>

<h2>Why has the support band check been removed in GHA?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Like the boss battles this was removed to simplify
editing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It means TheGHOST can work
with GH3 and GHA in the same way.</p>

<h2>What happens if I set the tier and song counts and leave the bonus songs
count blank?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>TheGHOST will modify the career tiers by adding or taking
from the bonus songs. If there are not enough songs in the bonus songs then
more will be added to ensure there at least 1. </p>

<h2>What happens if I set the bonus songs count and leave the tier and song
counts blank?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The career tier will be left untouched.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Only the bonus songs will be modified.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This is the approach to take if you want to
add songs and keep the boss battles.</p>

<h2>What happens if I set 1 tier with 2 songs then want to add more songs to
the same ISO later?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>TheGHOST will bring back the removed songs in the same order
they used to be in.</p>

<h2>This sounds very intricate, are there likely to be any bugs?</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Probably, this was really complicated to implement due to
all the combinations. If you find anything, just post it on the ScoreHero
forum.</p>
