- Song audio must always be present
- If Guitar audio is missing then Song is duplicated
- Guitar and Rhythm are audio are cropped if longer than the song.
 - If Rhythm audio is missing then 5 seconds of silence is created and used
- Section markers are calculated to the nearest Fret bar
- Fret Bars are removed up to the first note and generated back to the start of the track.
- The Frets always run past the last note or just before the end of the audio audio (whichever is longer).
- The audio is padded with silence if it is shorter than the last fret.
- If there is no TimeSig at position 0 after adjusting the notes/frets etc a 4/4 Time sig at position 0
- Everything is padded so that there is always a properly spaced fret at position 0

- GH3 sustain clipping ensures sustained notes are always at least 100ms shorter than the position of the next note
- SP notes are mapped to the nearest preceeding fret and note count recalculated
